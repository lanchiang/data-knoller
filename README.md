An under construction data preparation project.

Data preparation is the process transforming data before serving them to downstream tasks, such as data analysis, duplication detection, and machine learning. Much data do not meet the requirements of the following tasks, leading users, including both expert data scientists and novice data users, to frequently conduct ad-hoc data preparation. It is often reported that preparing data is a labour-intensive yet tedious work, which accounts for 50%-80% of the time spent in the whole data lifecycle.
